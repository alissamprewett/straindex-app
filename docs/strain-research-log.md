# StrainDex Strain Name/Data Research Log

Purpose: track candidate strain-name sources found so far, what's actually
usable in each, and what's queued up for future batches.

## Research methodology: multi-version / ambiguous-lineage strains

Applies whenever independent sources report *different* parentage for the
same strain name — extremely common for popular/generic names (fruit names,
color names, single-word names) that multiple unrelated breeders have all
used at some point. This is not the same problem as "no one knows the
parents" (a single strain with a genuinely undocumented lineage) — it's
"multiple different strains happen to share this name."

**The rule: use it if 2+ independent sources agree on the same specific
cross, even when other unrelated cuts exist under the same name. Skip it
if no single version clears that bar.**

- "Independent" means separate publishers, not two articles quoting the
  same original press release — e.g. Leafly and Weedmaps both stating the
  same breeder + parents independently counts; two SEO-farm articles that
  are clearly the same syndicated content do not.
- A specific parent-strain pairing (e.g. "Gelato #33 x 1991 Triangle Kush")
  counts as convergence. A vague shared theme (e.g. "some kind of OG
  Kush descendant") does not — that's just everyone agreeing the name
  sounds like an OG, not confirmation of an actual cross.
- If breeder attribution is disputed but the *parents* are consistent
  across sources, use the parents and either state the most-cited breeder
  or leave breeder blank — don't let breeder-name disagreement alone sink
  an otherwise well-corroborated cross.
- When a genuine winner emerges among several named versions (e.g. one
  cut is explicitly the origin and the "well known"/most documented cut,
  or is a well known/named breeder collaboration), use that version and
  note in the entry's flavor/effects that other cuts exist under the same
  name, rather than trying to average conflicting data together.

**Worked examples from actual research (for calibration):**
- *Used, multi-version but convergent*: Jungle Juice (3+ sources agree on
  Golden State Genetics' Animal Cookies x Tangie, despite at least two
  other unrelated "Jungle Juice" cuts existing), Tire Fire (Archive Seed
  Bank's Hi-Octane x Do-Si-Dos is far more documented than the other
  Weedmaps-acknowledged version), Wild Cherry, Kiwi Kush, Unicorn Piss,
  Tropical Punch, Bob Marley (genuinely unattributed lineage across every
  source, but the sensory profile itself was still consistent enough to
  document honestly as "breeder/parents unconfirmed").
- *Skipped, no convergence*: Pomegranate, Midnight, Paloma, Lucky, Boss —
  see "Unconfirmed / skipped strains" below for specifics on each.

**Practical note**: don't spend more than 2-3 searches trying to resolve
a name past this point — if the first couple of searches show 3+ clearly
unrelated confirmed crosses with no majority, it's faster and more honest
to log it as skipped (see below) than to keep digging for a tiebreaker
that may not exist.

## Source 1 — openthc/vdb (GPL-3.0)
GitHub: github.com/openthc/vdb — a purpose-built, community-submitted
directory of strain *names only* (no descriptions, effects, or potency
data). Explicitly published so other cannabis software can reuse it.

- Pulled: 12,804 total names, 11,175 not already in our library after
  filtering junk/duplicates.
- Quality: names only — real research still required per strain before
  writing an entry. Quality varies (from famous strains to obscure local
  one-off submissions).
- Status: saved, partially used (Lamb's Bread turned out to be a dupe,
  Blackwater OG added). ~11,100 names still unused.

## Source 2 — Kushy Cannabis Dataset (MIT license)
GitHub: github.com/kushyapp/cannabis-dataset — a much richer schema
(name, type, description, effects, flavor, crosses, cannabinoid %s), but
in practice mostly sparse:

- Pulled: 9,524 total strains, 7,951 not already in our library.
- **Type (Indica/Sativa/Hybrid) is well-populated: 7,928 of the 7,951 new
  names have it.** This is genuinely useful — it means future batches
  from this list don't need to research type from scratch, just THC
  range, terpenes, effects, and flavor.
- **Descriptions are essentially absent** — only 1 of 9,524 rows has a
  real description. Not a usable source for written content.
- **Effects/flavor are only populated for 4 of the new candidates** —
  not a meaningful bulk source, though those 4 are usable as-is.
- **THC/cannabinoid numeric fields are unreliable** — values are
  inconsistently scaled (appear to be percentage × 100, e.g. "1500"
  probably means 15%) and one value (127, likely meaning ~1.27%) repeats
  suspiciously often (157 times) in a way that looks like a leftover
  default/placeholder rather than 157 real identical measurements.
  **Recommendation: don't trust this field at all; research THC
  independently per strain the way we've been doing.**
- Status: saved (name + type + whatever effects/flavor/crosses exist) to
  a local candidate list, not yet used in a batch.

## Source 3 — Cannlytics Lab Results (CC BY 4.0)
Hugging Face: huggingface.co/datasets/cannlytics/cannabis_results — real
lab-tested COA (Certificate of Analysis) data across 14 states, with a
`strain_name` field and genuine measured `total_thc`/`total_cbd`/
`total_terpenes` values. Far more scientifically grounded than any
"guessed" figure, since these are real test results, not marketing copy.

- Not yet pulled — 6.28GB total, requires Python + the `datasets` library
  rather than a simple file download. In progress: Alissa is running a
  local pull script starting with the smallest state (NY, ~330 records)
  before scaling to a bigger one.
- Once pulled: this is the best candidate for *upgrading accuracy* of
  THC/CBD/terpene numbers on strains already in the library, not just
  adding new names.

---

## Up next
- Combine the openthc/vdb name list with Kushy's type-tagged list where
  they overlap, to prioritize names with at least a Type already known.
- Once Cannlytics NY data lands, check how many rows have a `strain_name`
  that matches something already in the library, as a first real-data
  accuracy check.

---

## Real lab-data validation (Cannlytics NY results, first batch)

Alissa successfully pulled `data/ny/ny-results-latest.csv` directly from
the Cannlytics dataset repo (330 real lab-tested cannabis products in
New York). Note: this file does **not** have a clean `strain_name`
column despite the dataset card describing one — strain names have to
be matched by searching within `product_name` text instead (e.g.
"Apple Fritter - .5g Disposable Vape").

**Method:** cross-referenced our strain library's names against
`product_name`, restricted to flower/preroll product types only
(concentrates and vape carts test 3-4x higher than flower for the same
strain, since they're extracted/concentrated — comparing those against
our flower-based THC ranges would be misleading).

**Result: found and fixed 2 confirmed bad entries.**
- Green Crack was listed as 1–6% THC. Real lab tests: 17.07–23.06%.
  Fixed to 15–25%.
- Diesel was listed as 1–6% THC. Real lab tests: 19.39–21.62%.
  Fixed to 15–21%.

**Most other matches confirmed our existing estimates were accurate**
(Gelato, Gary Payton, Hash Burger, Tropicana Cookies, Slurricane,
Jealousy, Durban Poison, Apple Fritter all landed within or very close
to our stated ranges).

**Bigger finding: 75 strains in the library (mostly from the original
pre-existing starter dataset, not from any batch added during this
project) share the exact same "1–6%" THC value.** This is almost
certainly a leftover placeholder/default from however the original
1,500-strain seed data was built, the same bug pattern caught in Green
Crack and Diesel above. Important caveat: **not all 75 are necessarily
wrong** — a few (like ACDC) are genuinely real high-CBD, low-THC
strains where 1–6% is accurate. Each one needs individual verification
before changing it, the same way Green Crack and Diesel were confirmed
with real lab data before fixing. Full list saved for future batches.

**Up next:** work through the 75-strain "1–6%" suspect list a batch at
a time, verifying each individually (real research or more Cannlytics
state pulls) before correcting. Also worth pulling a bigger state next
(e.g. `ca` or `wa`) now that the direct-CSV-download approach is
confirmed working, for a larger validation sample.

## Real lab-data validation (Cannlytics CA results, second batch)

Alissa pulled `data/ca/ca-results-latest.csv` (71,000+ real lab-tested
products) directly from the repo — file was 1.59GB, too large to
upload, so we wrote a script to strip out the heavy per-compound
`results` column and keep just the summary fields, bringing it down to
~9MB (85,487 rows) as `ca-results-slim.csv`.

**Method:** same as the NY batch — flower/preroll product types only,
excluding concentrates/infused/resin (which test 3-4x higher for the
same strain since they're extracted). Also filtered out physically
impossible THC values (some rows showed 100%+, even 300%+ — clearly a
data quality issue in the source file itself, not real measurements).
Required at least 8 real samples per strain before drawing any
conclusion.

**Results, out of 128 strains with enough samples to check:**
- **96 confirmed accurate** — real median THC fell right within what
  we already had. Good validation of the earlier research work.
- **32 strains updated** to real current-market ranges (25th-75th
  percentile of actual lab results), since Alissa's call was to reflect
  current real data rather than older "classic" reference ranges. This
  mostly pushed ranges up by 8-15 points (e.g. Diesel 15–21% → 25–28%,
  Headband 12–20% → 32–35%) — consistent with the well-documented
  industry-wide potency increase over the past decade, not a sign the
  old numbers were "wrong," just dated.
- **1 real outlier investigated individually: Space Queen.** Real CA
  data showed a suspiciously low 8.1% median (n=12), while every
  independent published source (Strainpedia, Leafly, Hytiva, StrainHub)
  consistently cites 15-22%. Traced the anomaly to hemp-derived
  "Space Queen" products (<0.3% THC by law) being sold under the same
  name and polluting the product-name match. Adjusted our own figure
  slightly (23–27% → 16–22%) to align with the well-corroborated
  published consensus — did not use either the real-data anomaly or
  the original figure as-is.

**Also fixed from the earlier NY batch:** Green Crack (1–6% → 15–25%)
and Diesel (1–6% → then further updated to 25–28% with the larger CA
sample above).

**Lesson for future batches:** raw "real lab data" isn't automatically
more trustworthy than researched estimates — it still needs the same
scrutiny (physically impossible values, product-type mismatches,
mislabeled/hemp variants polluting name matches). Real data is best
used to *cross-check* research, not replace judgment.

## Up next
- 74 of the original 75 "1–6% THC" suspects are still unverified
  (Green Crack and Diesel are now fixed). Continue working through that
  list a batch at a time.
- Consider pulling one more state (WA has the largest sample at
  202,812 records) for a broader validation pass once useful.

## Unconfirmed / skipped strains (revisit later)

Names pulled from the Weedmaps directory audit's "missing strain" lists
that were researched but **not added**, per the multi-version methodology
above. Logged here so future sessions don't burn searches re-discovering
the same dead ends — check this list before re-researching a name below.
Each entry can be revisited if a future search turns up a breeder
publishing an official lineage, or a second independent source starts
agreeing with one of the versions already found.

- **Pomegranate** (plain name) — no data exists for the plain name itself.
  Only unrelated *named variants* are documented: Pomegranate Shake
  (Weedmaps confirms this itself is two different crosses), Black
  Pomegranate (Massive Seeds), Purple Pomegranate, Berry Pomegranate.
  None of these establish anything about a plain "Pomegranate."
- **Midnight** (plain name) — at least 3 unrelated confirmed cultivars:
  Tikun Olam's secret-formula medical strain (CBD-dominant, Israel),
  3rd Coast Genetics' indica-leaning cut (parents undisclosed), and an
  "unknown combination" per AllBud. No convergence between any two.
- **Paloma** (plain name) — at least 4 unrelated confirmed crosses:
  1937 Farms/Raw Genetics' "Cherry Paloma" (Tropicanna Cherries x
  Georgia Pie), Green Dot Labs' (Pirate Milk x ROYGBIV Red), Symbiotic
  Genetics' (Grapefruit x Durban Poison), Weedys' (Grapefruit Fly x
  Durban Poison). Four different specific crosses, no majority.
- **Lucky** (plain name) — no confirmable lineage at all. Weedmaps'
  own strain page explicitly states they're "still gathering
  information." The one other result found (GrowDiaries) appears to be
  a data/content mismatch — it describes Bodhi Seeds' "Ice Cream Cake"
  genetics under a page titled "Lucky," which reads like a template or
  indexing error rather than real data about a strain called Lucky.
- **Boss** (plain name) — even the closest-matching named version,
  "Boss OG," has 3 conflicting confirmed parentages across sources:
  OG Kush x Fire OG, Dark Heart Nursery's backcrossed OG Kush phenotype
  (no named second parent), and OG Kush x Strawberry Diesel. No majority
  among the three, and the plain "Boss" (without "OG") wasn't confirmably
  distinguished from "Boss OG" in any source, adding another layer of
  ambiguity on top of the parentage conflict itself.
